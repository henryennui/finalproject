Henry Christopher LIS549 final project

This quarter I am taking an independent study with Doc Martin, where I am developing curriculum for her organization, Read-a-Rama, which provides read aloud and storytime programs. The work that I am doing is reviewing many picture books and choosing the best for my chosen themes, and develop some activities and crafts to accompany them. My two themes are 1) socioemotional learning and 2) gender diversity and exploration. As this work is going to be compiled mostly for the organization's internal library, this project seems like a good opportunity to showcase some of the work that I am doing in a way that I can share and even reference in future job applications, as well as even reference for my own use in my future as a children's librarian.

So, my plan is to list some of the books I am choosing for my curriculum, with the accompanying information I am developing for each item (summary, review, suggested discussion questions, activities, similar books). I can include pictures of the cover or inner illustrations, pictures of the author and/or illustrator.
