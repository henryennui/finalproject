Henry Christopher LIS 549 final project

https://henryennui.github.io/finalproject/

This quarter I am taking an independent study with Professor Michelle Martin, where I am developing curriculum for her organization, Read-a-Rama, which provides read aloud and storytime programs. The work that I am doing is reviewing many picture books and choosing the best for my chosen themes, and developing some activities and crafts to accompany them. My broad themes include: 
    1) socioemotional learning & civic development 
    2) gender diversity and exploration
    3) managing difficult emotions & mindfulness
As this work is going to be compiled mostly for the organization's internal library, this project seems like a good opportunity to showcase some of the work that I am doing in a way that I can share and even reference in future job applications, as well as even reference for my own use in my future as a children's librarian.

So, my plan is to list some of the books I am choosing for my curriculum, with the accompanying information I am developing for each item (summary, review, suggested discussion questions, activities, similar books). I can include pictures of the cover or inner illustrations, pictures of the author and/or illustrator. 

I am also compiling facilitator resources, so I could make a page with links to these as well.

I will also have an 'about' page where I give a brief bio, maybe link my resume, contact info, and maybe describe some of my process and objectives with the project and final curriculum.
